#  Machine Learning for Depth Thermography: Predicting Volumetric Temperature Distributions from Thermal-Emission Spectral Data

## Abstract
Predicting temperature distributions beneath the surface of objects is of high interest for a variety of science and engineering applications. Here, we develop a machine learning model built from a technique called depth thermography, based on infrared thermal spectrum data that can remotely determine volumetric temperature distributions. Currently, depth thermography uses physical equations to make its predictionsâ€”however, these equations are highly noise-sensitive. To combat this issue, we have developed a shallow neural network that can make accurate decisions with noisy input data. The models in this repository are tuned for three different media: Fused Silica, Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium antimonide (InSb)

## Files and Usage
### Configuration Files: 
fused_silica.json, GaN_config.json, InSb_config.json

These files contain the neural network model training parameters as well as the necessary file paths for training and testing. Any adjustments made to the training data path and model parameters will be made here.
