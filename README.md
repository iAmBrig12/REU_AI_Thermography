#  Machine Learning for Depth Thermography: Predicting Volumetric Temperature Distributions from Thermal-Emission Spectral Data

## Abstract
Predicting temperature distributions beneath the surface of objects is of high interest for a variety of science and engineering applications. Here, we develop a machine learning model built from a technique called depth thermography, based on infrared thermal spectrum data that can remotely determine volumetric temperature distributions. Currently, depth thermography uses physical equations to make its predictionsâ€”however, these equations are highly noise-sensitive. To combat this issue, we have developed a shallow neural network that can make accurate decisions with noisy input data. The models in this repository are tuned for three different media: Fused Silica, Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium antimonide (InSb)

## Files
### Configuration Files: 
#### fused_silica.json, GaN_config.json, InSb_config.json

- Json configuration files containing the neural network model training parameters as well as the necessary file paths for training and testing. 
- Any adjustments made to the training data path and model parameters will be made here.

### Neural Network:
#### thermography_model.py
- Python script to build neural network
- The structure of the network is dynamic based on the configuration file provided to accomodate different media

### Model Training:
#### train.py
- Python script to train a model using a config file and training data file
- Trained model will be saved to a path designated by config file

#### fused_silica_train.xlsx, GaN_train.xlsx, InSb_train.xlsx
- Training files for models

### Model Testing: 
#### test.py
- Python script to test a model specified in the config file 
- It will test all files in a given folder
- Results are saved in Fused Silica results, GaN results, or InSb results, as specified in config file
- Testing results:
    - All Temperature Prediction for a Sample - Visualization of the predictions made for a random sample across all test files
    - Average Loss Per Layer for <test_file> - Visulization of the MAE loss per material layer for each test file
    - Temperature Predictions of a Random Sample for <test_file> - Visualization of predictions for a random sample made using each test file
    - <material> test losses - Excel file with testing results for each file

#### Fused Silica results, GaN results, InSb results
- Folders that testing results are saved to
- These folders must be made before testing and are specified in config files

#### fused_silica_gauss, GaN_gauss, InSb_gauss
- These folders contain testing data for each material
- Testing data has a Gaussian distribution of noise applied to the exact values computed using depth thermography equations
- Noise distributions are: exact, SNR=55, SNR=50, SNR=45, and SNR=35, where SNR=35 represents the highest amount of noise and SNR=50 being the closest to what is expected from experimental data

### Data Visualization:
#### data_visualization.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the noise added to the data in test files
