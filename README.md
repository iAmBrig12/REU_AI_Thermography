#  Machine Learning for Depth Thermography: Predicting Volumetric Temperature Distributions from Thermal-Emission Spectral Data

## Abstract
Predicting temperature distributions beneath the surface of objects is of high interest for a variety of science and engineering applications. Here, we develop a machine learning model built from a technique called depth thermography, based on infrared thermal spectrum data that can remotely determine volumetric temperature distributions. Currently, depth thermography uses physical equations to make its predictionsâ€”however, these equations are highly noise-sensitive. To combat this issue, we have developed a shallow neural network that can make accurate decisions with noisy input data. The models in this repository are tuned for three different media: Fused Silica, Gallium Nitride (GaN), and Indium antimonide (InSb)

## Files
### Configuration Files: 
#### fused_silica.json, GaN_config.json, InSb_config.json

- Json configuration files containing the neural network model training.
- Any adjustments made to the training data path and model parameters will be made here.

### Neural Network:
#### thermography_model.py
- Python script to build neural network.
- The structure of the network is dynamic based on the configuration file provided to accomodate different media.

### Model Training:
#### train.py
- Python script to train a model using a config file and training data file.
- Trained model state dictionary will be saved to a path designated by the user in the command line input.
- All models are saved in the Models folder under the material that it was trained for

### Model Testing: 
#### test.py
- Python script to test a model specified in the command line
- It will test all files in a folder given in the command line
- Results are saved in Test Results under the material specified in config file. Under the material folders are the results for individual models.
- Testing results:
    - Test Losses - MAE Loss calculations per test file for the given model
    - Predictions - predictions made using each test file for the given model to be used in further testing or visualization.

#### fused_silica_gauss, GaN_gauss, InSb_gauss
- These folders contain testing data for each material
- Testing data has a Gaussian distribution of noise applied to the exact values computed using depth thermography equations

### Data Visualization:
#### data_visualization.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook that visualizes the noise added to the data in test files
