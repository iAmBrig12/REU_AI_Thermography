# REU_AI_Thermography

### Final Models: 
### - Use data.3nm.xlsx file

### feedforward.ipynb
#### description: Simple feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers. Most accurate model.


### tandem_final.ipynb
#### description: Combines spectrum to temperature network with a temperature to spectrum network


### ff_one_layer.ipynb
#### description: Feature-selected network that predicts each temperature layer individually

### Old Code Folder: 
### Original attempt at Thermography project by other people

### Underdeveloped Attempts:
### This project attempted different network topologies and approaches. These attempts were not as fully developed as the final models. 

#### data Folder: 
### This contains all of the data we had been given; however, the latest data we used was the data_3nm.xlsx file that is not in this folder.
